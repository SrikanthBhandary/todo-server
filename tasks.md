Here are some tasks to help you further develop your Go skills, focusing on different aspects of the language and software design principles:

### Tasks:

1. **Enhance the ToDo Application:**
   - **Add Persistence:** Implement a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store your ToDo items. Use an ORM like GORM or a SQL package to manage data operations.
   - **Implement User Authentication:** Create a user registration and login system using JWT tokens for secure authentication.

2. **Concurrency Practice:**
   - **Worker Pool:** Create a worker pool that processes tasks concurrently. For example, simulate processing ToDo items (e.g., sending notifications).
   - **Rate Limiter:** Build a rate limiter that restricts the number of requests processed per time interval (e.g., 5 requests per second).

3. **API Development:**
   - **Create a RESTful API:** Expand your ToDo application to include more RESTful endpoints (e.g., update a ToDo, filter by date, etc.).
   - **Implement Pagination:** Add pagination to your API responses to handle large sets of ToDo items.

4. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - **Improve Error Handling:** Enhance your error handling strategy. Create custom error types and a centralized error handling middleware for your HTTP server.
   - **Logging:** Integrate a logging library (like `logrus` or `zap`) for structured logging throughout your application.

5. **Testing:**
   - **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for your ToDo service methods and the HTTP handlers. Use table-driven tests to cover various scenarios.
   - **Integration Testing:** Create integration tests for your HTTP endpoints to verify that they interact correctly with the database.

6. **Design Patterns:**
   - **Implement a Strategy Pattern:** Create a strategy for different notification methods (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) in your ToDo application.
   - **Builder Pattern:** Implement the builder pattern for creating complex ToDo objects with multiple attributes.

7. **Concurrency Patterns:**
   - **Implement a Pub/Sub System:** Create a publish-subscribe messaging system where different components of your application can communicate asynchronously.

8. **Configuration Management:**
   - **Create a Configuration Manager:** Build a configuration manager that loads settings from a YAML file and allows runtime updates. [Done]
